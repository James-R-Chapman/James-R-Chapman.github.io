The Chernobyl disaster was a nuclear accident that occurred on Saturday 26 April 1986, The below is a graphing of the radiation as it spread to countries across Europe as found in the Dataset ‘Chernobyl Data (Air Concentration)’ As a study of airborne concentrations of Iodine-131(I131), Caesium-134 (Cs134) and Caesium-137(Cs137).

West Berlin Germany approximately 721 Miles (1160 KM) from Chernobyl
As shown above with a slightly Northwest orientation to the initial incident it took approximately four days for the radiation levels to start showing. Two days after the initial exposure the radiation levels fell back down and then leveled out for the following week until falling back down to a nearly nonexistent level. Also, note that there is no evidence of Caesium-137 present in these samples.

Chinon France approximately 1372 Miles (2208 KM) from Chernobyl
For Chinon, France, the effect was still high, with a slightly southwest direction they did not exhibit signs of the exposure until six days later. Once exposure occurred, it only took 2 days to return down to a normal level.

Budapest Hungary approximately 561 Miles (904 KM) from Chernobyl
Budapest, Hungary is one of the closest samples on the data list. It shows an incline in radiation only four days after the incident spiked to an extremely poisonous level then dropped to a tolerable level then spiked again only five days later.

Glasnevin Iran approximately 1778 Miles (2861 KM) from Chernobyl
Glasnevin, Iran is one of the test samples that had a large number of measurement days but showed no radiation other than Caesium-134 with the exposure happening six days after the incident. Iran does sit Southeast of Chernobyl but does make one curious as to why only the Caesium-134 would have contaminated the area and not Iodine-131 or Caesium-137, all other areas show a direct correlation to the amount of radiation in the air.
